        "Se pudo observar que cambiando las unidades había diferencia tanto del MSE y la predicción, después de hacer varias combinaciones se encontró que este modelo llega mejor al resultado real dando valores entre 6.01-6.53. El problema es que cada vez que se corre da nuevos valores y pueden ser valores cerca como alejados del resultado real puede ser por como funciona el optimizados sgd. Si se utilizan muchas neuronas puede dar un overfitting y siempre se obtenía un valor de 6.66 en la mayoría de corridas con modelos que tenían alta cantidad de neuronas. Asimismo, se puede mejorar el modelo utilizando un diferente optimizador como adam y otras funciones de activación como relu que dan mejores resultados. "
